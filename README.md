### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
It's have been really challenges and difficult for me since day one. learned how to analises the excel spreadsheets on a different aspect and way. It's hard but interesting at the same time. the formules are most new for me. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    - Best months are from April to September.
    - We have more successful than failed or cancelled.
    
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    - best funds to be ask will be from $1000 thru $4999
    
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    - For me was at first if you dont pay attention to the table and analises the result, you could end up with a different interpretation. 
    
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    - you could create how many funds are from US and how many from other country.
